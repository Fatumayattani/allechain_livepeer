## Tokenization & Smart Contracts
We tested our smart contracts using **Remix IDE**, a powerful tool for Ethereum contract development. Remix helped us simulate and verify the contract behavior in a secure environment before deploying it to the Ethereum network. The contract was thoroughly tested for key features like:

- **NFT creation**: Ensuring the minting process for music and podcast NFTs works as expected.
- **Token staking**: Verifying that tokens can be staked and unstaked correctly.
- **Transactions**: Ensuring safe and secure transfers of NFTs between users.
